# Tic Tac Toe

The classic game of Tic Tac Toe involves two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 x 3 grid. The first player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins!

This version of Tic Tac Toe has three difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard. It also features two-player mode (local only) in addition to single-player mode.
